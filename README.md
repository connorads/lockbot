> Coordinate use of your team's shared resources, in Slack 🤝

Lockbot only lets each shared resource be locked by one person at a time - like a Mutex 🔒

_Example use case: One person wants to deploy and test on a shared staging environment without someone else deploying and overwriting their deployed code, so they use `/lock staging-env` to lock the staging environment and notify the channel._

⚠ Lockbot cannot physically prevent naughty or unaware users from using a resource whilst it's locked by someone else.
Your team must agree to use Lockbot whenever they start or stop using a shared resource.

## How to use Lockbot

Lockbot has three commands:

- `/locks` Get locked resources list 📜
- `/lock [resource name]` Lock a resource 🔒
- `/unlock [resource name]` Unlock a resource 🔓

Each Slack channel has its own list of resources.

When someone successfully locks or unlocks a resource, the channel is notified.
